1.findContactIndex and getTenDigitPhone benefit the source code by greatly simplyfing it.
This is accomplished by increasing the readability of the code, making debugging simpler
and allowing these functions to be used within other functions that prevents having to write
redundant lines of code. These functions ensure other functions work properly by providing them
with valid input from the user.

2. I learned a lot from this assignment. Mainly how variables and values can be passed
around to different functions and what happens to a variable when it is sent and altered
in a different function. I also learned about pointers and now possess a better understanding as
to how the computer handles memory allocation in particular when it comes to arrays and structures.
